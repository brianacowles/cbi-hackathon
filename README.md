*This project was created as part of the CBI 2021 Intern Hackathon*

For many members of LDA Gen Z, alcohol is for special occasions, but these occasions can be hard to come by when you're burdened by huge student loans and tons of other expenses. Party Penny makes it easy to budget for and plan a fun night out.

### Health

One of the reasons alcohol is consumed less often by LDA Gen Z is concern regarding mental and physical health. Party Penny helps the user moderate their consumption by staying in budget, reducing stigma and building lifelong brand loyalty by turning a one time purchase into an experience to remember.

### Financial Security

Another big reason LDA Gen Z drinks less - they can't afford it! Budgeting is hard, and budgeting for fun is even harder. Ensuring users have a fun budget sets Party Penny apart from other financial planning apps and promotes financial freedom by making a fun night out accessible for every budget.
